A straightforward Python script that utilizes the TinyURL API to create shortened URLs from long ones. This tool is ideal for simplifying URLs for social media, emails, or other purposes.

## Features:
- Converts any long URL into a TinyURL.
- Simple, clean, and easy-to-use interface.
- Works with Python 3.x and supports both `urllib` and `contextlib`.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SagarBiswas-MultiHAT/TinyURL-Shortener.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd TinyURL-Shortener
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python tinyurl_shortener.py
   ```
4. Input the URL you want to shorten when prompted:
   ```
   ==> Enter the URL to shorten: https://example.com/very-long-url
   ```
5. The shortened URL will be displayed:
   ```
   ..:: New url: http://tinyurl.com/abcd123
   ```

## How It Works:
- The script sends the long URL to TinyURL's API endpoint and retrieves the shortened URL.
